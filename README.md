# Ice-Dragon
Comodo IceDragon is a Firefox-based open source web browser from the Comodo Group for Microsoft Windows.
# Features
- Firefox-based: IceDragon is based on the Firefox 65 codebase. It provides detection for Firefox hard-coded plugin installations.
- SiteInspector: Comodo's SiteInspector malware detection system is integrated into IceDragon. SiteInspector's link scanning feature allows one to check whether a web page is malicious before they visit that page.
- SecureDNS service: IceDragon offers Comodo's Secure DNS Service to users as an alternative to using their Internet Service Provider.
- This is intended to produce faster page loads and safer browsing because SecureDNS references a real-time block list (RBL) of malicious websites.
